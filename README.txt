Connect Google Sheets with Homey, and log any type of data to your spreadsheets from a Flow.

Measure your smart plug's energy usage, log the weather station's temperature or events when someone came home. It's entirely up to you.

After installing the Google Sheets app an additional step is needed before you can use it in your Flows. 

Open the Homey Web App in your browser or the Homey Mobile App on your phone, go to the Devices screen and select "+" to add a new device. Select the Google sheets app and connect with a Google account.

A device tile will be created for this Google account and you can start using it in Flows with the now created Flow cards.
